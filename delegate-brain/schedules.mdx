# Schedules

Schedules let your delegate wake up at specific times to check in and take action. They're how you automate recurring work.

## What Schedules Do

A schedule tells your delegate to wake up at regular intervals and do something. Common uses:

- **Status checks** - "Every Monday, review project status and post an update"
- **Reminders** - "Every Friday at 3pm, remind me to submit my timesheet"
- **Monitoring** - "Every day, check my inbox for urgent customer emails"
- **Reports** - "Every week, create a summary of completed tasks"

## Creating Schedules

### Through Conversation

The easiest way to create a schedule:

> "Every Monday at 9am, review my calendar for the week and flag any conflicts."

> "Check my email every morning and summarize anything urgent."

Your delegate will create the schedule and confirm the details.

### Direct Setup

Create schedules in the brain:

1. Open the Delegate Brain
2. Click on the **Schedules** section
3. Configure the schedule details

## Schedule Configuration

Each schedule includes:

### Interval

How often the schedule runs:

- **Minutes** - Every X minutes
- **Hours** - Every X hours
- **Days** - Every X days
- **Weeks** - Every X weeks

### Time

When during the interval to run:

- **Time of day** - 9:00 AM, 2:30 PM, etc.
- **Day of week** - Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- **Timezone** - Your local timezone

### Instructions

What your delegate should do when the schedule runs:

> "Check my inbox for emails from the executive team. If there are any, summarize them and post to the activity feed."

## Example Schedules

### Weekly Status Update

```
Interval: Weekly (every Monday)
Time: 9:00 AM
Instructions: Review all tasks and projects. Create a status
canvas showing: completed items, in-progress items, blocked
items. Post to the activity feed.
```

### Daily Email Check

```
Interval: Daily
Time: 8:00 AM
Instructions: Check my Gmail for unread messages. Summarize
any that need my attention, prioritized by urgency. Skip
newsletters and automated notifications.
```

### Bi-weekly Report

```
Interval: Every 2 weeks (Friday)
Time: 4:00 PM
Instructions: Create a summary of all work completed in the
past two weeks. Include metrics where available. Format as
a canvas and post to the feed.
```

## Managing Schedules

### Pausing

Temporarily stop a schedule without deleting it:

> "Pause the Monday status updates while I'm on vacation."

### Resuming

Restart a paused schedule:

> "Resume the Monday status updates."

### Editing

Change schedule details:

> "Change the status update from Monday to Tuesday."

### Deleting

Remove a schedule entirely:

> "Cancel the daily email check schedule."

## Viewing Execution History

You can see when schedules have run and what happened:

1. Open the schedule in the brain
2. View the execution history
3. See what your delegate did each time

This helps you verify schedules are working as expected.

## Running Manually

You can trigger a schedule immediately without waiting:

> "Run the weekly status update now."

This is useful for testing or when you need the output before the scheduled time.

## One-time vs. Recurring

You can create schedules that run once or repeatedly:

| One-time | Recurring |
|----------|-----------|
| Runs once then completes | Keeps running on interval |
| "Remind me in 3 days" | "Every Monday at 9am" |
| Good for specific deadlines | Good for ongoing automation |

To create a one-time schedule, simply tell your delegate when you need the reminder:

> "In 3 days, remind me to follow up with the client."

Your delegate creates a schedule that runs once and then marks itself complete.

## Tips for Good Schedules

### Be Specific

Include clear instructions about what to check and what action to take.

### Set Appropriate Frequency

Daily checks for urgent things, weekly for status updates, monthly for reports.

### Include Output Instructions

Tell your delegate whether to post to the feed, send you a message, or take other action.
