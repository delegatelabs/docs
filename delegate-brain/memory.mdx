# Memory

The Memory section stores what your delegate has learned about you, your preferences, and your work. It's how your delegate maintains context over time.

## What Memory Contains

Your delegate's memory includes:

- **Preferences** - How you like things done
- **Context** - Background about your work and projects
- **People** - Information about colleagues and contacts
- **Decisions** - Past choices and their reasoning
- **Feedback** - Corrections and improvements you've made

## How Memory Works

### Automatic Learning

Your delegate learns from every conversation. When you say:

> "Always CC my manager on client emails."

> "I prefer morning meetings over afternoon ones."

> "The Johnson account is our highest priority."

Your delegate stores this in memory and applies it to future work.

### Memory Updates

When your delegate updates its memory, you'll see a notification. This keeps you informed about what your delegate is learning.

You can review and edit memories at any time in the brain.

### How Memory Gets Updated

After each conversation, your delegate's brain curator reviews what happened and decides what to remember:

**What gets automatically saved:**
- **Your revelations** - Preferences, context, relationships, communication style
- **Instructions** - How you want things done
- **Corrections** - Feedback on its behavior
- **Executor learnings** - Information gathered from tools, decisions made, problems encountered
- **Work status changes** - New tasks, completions, blockers, follow-ups

**Where memories live:**
- Short-term context stays in the conversation
- Long-term memories go to the Memory section
- Progress and status go to the Progress Log
- Pending issues go to Unfinished Business
- Tasks get their own files with status tracking

The brain curator also consolidates related memories, prunes outdated information, and avoids duplicating what's already stored. You don't need to manually manage your delegate's memory - it learns from your conversations naturally.

## Viewing Memory

Open the Delegate Brain and click the **Memory** section. You'll see stored memories organized by topic.

### How Memory is Organized

Your delegate can organize memories into directories by type. Common categories include:

- `/memory/people/` - Information about colleagues and contacts
- `/memory/decisions/` - Past decisions and their reasoning
- `/memory/preferences/` - Your preferences and how you like things done

These directories are suggestions - you can organize memories however makes sense for your work.

Each memory file is kept concise (under 500 words) with relevant dates for time-sensitive information.

<Note>
Your delegate also maintains long-term memory from conversations automatically. This helps it recall context from past interactions without you needing to add it manually.
</Note>

### Example Memories

```markdown
## Communication Preferences
- Prefers bullet points over long paragraphs
- Likes executive summaries at the top of documents
- Wants action items clearly called out

## Key Contacts
- Sarah (manager) - Include on important decisions
- Mike (engineering lead) - Point of contact for technical questions
- Lisa (customer success) - Handles customer escalations

## Project Context
- Q2 initiative is highest priority
- Budget decisions need VP approval
- Weekly stakeholder meeting is Thursdays at 2pm
```

## Editing Memory

You can edit memories directly or through conversation:

### Direct Edit

1. Open the Memory section
2. Click on a memory to edit
3. Update or delete as needed

### Through Conversation

> "Actually, Sarah moved to a different team - remove her as my manager."

> "Update your memory: we now do standups at 9am instead of 10am."

## Memory vs. Tasks

| Memory | Tasks |
|--------|-------|
| Persistent context | Specific work items |
| Background information | Things to accomplish |
| No end date | Has completion |
| "Sarah is my manager" | "Email Sarah about the proposal" |

Memory provides the context your delegate uses when working on tasks.

## Privacy and Memory

Your delegate's memory is private to your initiative. Team members can't see what your delegate has learned about you.

If you're concerned about specific information, you can:

- Review what's stored in memory
- Delete specific memories
- Ask your delegate to forget something

## Long-term Context

Memory gives your delegate long-term context that persists across conversations. Unlike a regular chatbot that forgets everything, your delegate remembers and applies what it has learned.

This is why your delegate gets better over time - it's building up a memory of how you work.
