# Delegate Brain Overview

The Delegate Brain is the control center for your delegate. It's where you configure how your delegate thinks, communicates, and takes action.

## Accessing the Brain

Click the **Brain** tab in the right panel of your initiative. You'll see all the configuration sections that control your delegate's behavior.

## Brain Sections

The Delegate Brain is organized into sections, each controlling a different aspect of your delegate:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Identity" icon="user" href="/delegate-brain/identity">
    Personality, tone, and communication style
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tasks" icon="list-check" href="/delegate-brain/tasks">
    Active work your delegate is focused on
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory" icon="lightbulb" href="/delegate-brain/memory">
    What your delegate remembers about you
  </Card>
  <Card title="Skills" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/delegate-brain/skills">
    Specialized procedures and workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schedules" icon="clock" href="/delegate-brain/schedules">
    Recurring check-ins and automations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permissions" icon="shield" href="/integrations/permissions">
    What tools and resources your delegate can access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Sections

- **Progress Log** - A running log of what your delegate has accomplished
- **Unfinished Business** - Pending items your delegate still needs to complete

### Shared Sections

Some sections are shared across all delegates in the initiative:

- **Initiative Context** - Background information about the project that all delegates can reference
- **Notifications** - How the delegate notifies stakeholders about important updates

## Who Can Edit

Only the **initiative owner** can edit the Delegate Brain. If you're a member of an initiative (not the owner), you can view the brain but not modify it.

This ensures one person controls how the delegate behaves, preventing conflicting configurations.

## How the Brain Affects Your Delegate

Everything in the brain influences your delegate's behavior:

| Section | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Identity | Shapes communication style and personality |
| Tasks | Guides what your delegate prioritizes |
| Memory | Provides context for decisions |
| Skills | Determines how specific tasks are handled |
| Schedules | Triggers automatic check-ins |
| Permissions | Controls what actions are possible |

When you chat with your delegate, it draws on all of this to provide relevant, personalized responses.

## Editing the Brain

You can edit the brain in two ways:

### Direct Editing

Click on any section to expand it and edit the content directly. Changes save automatically.

### Through Conversation

Your delegate can update its own brain based on your conversations. When you say things like:

> "Remember that I prefer bullet points over paragraphs."

> "Add 'follow up with Sarah' to your tasks."

Your delegate updates the relevant brain section automatically.

## How Brain Data is Stored

Behind the scenes, the brain is stored as a virtual filesystem in the database. Each section corresponds to one or more paths:

- `/identity.md` - Your delegate's personality
- `/tasks/` - Active tasks (stored as individual task files)
- `/memory/` - Learned information organized by topic (e.g., `/memory/people/`, `/memory/decisions/`)
- `/skills/` - Specialized procedures
- `/progress-log.txt` - Activity log
- `/unfinished-business.md` - Pending items

You don't need to interact with these paths directly - the UI handles everything. But knowing this structure exists helps you understand how your delegate organizes information.
