# Tasks

The Tasks section is where you assign work to your delegate. Tasks give your delegate clear goals to work toward and help it prioritize what to focus on.

## What Tasks Are

A task is a specific piece of work you want your delegate to accomplish. Tasks typically include:

- **Goal** - What needs to be done
- **Success criteria** - How you'll know it's complete
- **Context** - Background information needed

## Creating Tasks

### Through Conversation

The easiest way to create a task is through your chat:

> "I need you to draft a project proposal for the Q2 initiative."

> "Add to your tasks: research competitors and create a comparison table."

Your delegate will add the task to its brain and start working on it.

### Direct Editing

You can also create tasks directly in the brain:

1. Open the Delegate Brain
2. Click on the **Tasks** section
3. Add your task with a clear description

### Example Task

```markdown
## Draft Q2 Project Proposal

**Goal:** Create a project proposal document for the Q2 product initiative.

**Success Criteria:**
- Executive summary (1 paragraph)
- Problem statement with data
- Proposed solution with timeline
- Resource requirements
- Risk assessment

**Context:**
- Use the project brief in Google Drive
- Reference last quarter's proposal for format
- Due by Friday for stakeholder review
```

## Task States

Tasks go through different states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Pending** | Not yet started |
| **In Progress** | Currently being worked on |
| **Completed** | Done and verified |
| **Blocked** | Waiting on external dependency |

Your delegate updates task states as work progresses. Completed tasks are hidden from the active list and may be referenced in the Progress Log.

## How Delegates Work on Tasks

When your delegate has tasks, it:

1. **Prioritizes** based on urgency and your instructions
2. **Works incrementally** - making progress over multiple conversations
3. **Reports status** - keeping you informed of progress
4. **Asks questions** - when it needs clarification or input

You can check on task progress anytime:

> "What's the status on the project proposal?"

> "What tasks are you working on right now?"

## Multiple Tasks

Your delegate can handle multiple tasks at once. It will:

- Prioritize based on urgency and importance
- Context-switch between tasks as needed
- Track progress on each separately

If you have preferences about prioritization, tell your delegate:

> "The proposal is highest priority - focus on that first."

## Tasks vs. Other Brain Sections

| Use Tasks For | Use Something Else |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Specific work items | Ongoing responsibilities (Identity) |
| Things with end dates | Recurring work (Schedules) |
| One-time projects | Reusable procedures (Skills) |

## Completing Tasks

When a task is done, your delegate marks it complete and may:

- Post an update to the Activity Feed
- Move details to the Progress Log
- Ask for your confirmation

You can also manually mark tasks complete in the brain.
