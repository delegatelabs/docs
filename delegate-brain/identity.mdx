# Identity

The Identity section controls how your delegate communicates. It's where you define your delegate's personality, tone, and style.

## What Identity Controls

Your delegate's identity affects:

- **Tone** - Formal, casual, friendly, professional
- **Communication style** - Concise vs. detailed, bullet points vs. prose
- **Personality traits** - Helpful, direct, empathetic, analytical
- **Role** - How your delegate sees itself and its responsibilities

## Setting Up Identity

To configure your delegate's identity:

1. Open the Delegate Brain
2. Click on the **Identity** section
3. Write a description of how you want your delegate to communicate

### Example Identity

```markdown
I am a helpful, professional assistant focused on clear communication.

**Communication Style:**
- I prefer concise responses with bullet points
- I use a friendly but professional tone
- I ask clarifying questions when instructions are ambiguous

**Priorities:**
- Accuracy over speed
- Clarity over completeness
- Action items clearly highlighted

**Role:**
I help manage communications, draft documents, and coordinate across tools.
```

## Tips for Good Identity Configuration

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Be helpful"

Try: "Respond with empathy but keep answers focused on actionable next steps"

### Include Preferences

Tell your delegate how you like information presented:

- "Always summarize emails in 3 bullet points or less"
- "Start responses with the key takeaway"
- "Use headers to organize longer responses"

### Define Boundaries

Clarify what your delegate should and shouldn't do:

- "Always ask before sending emails on my behalf"
- "Don't make assumptions about priorities - ask me"
- "Flag anything that seems urgent for my review"

## Identity vs. Instructions

Identity is about **who** your delegate is. For **what** your delegate should do, use:

- **Tasks** - For specific work items
- **Skills** - For step-by-step procedures
- **Schedules** - For recurring automations

Identity should describe personality and communication style, not specific tasks or procedures.

## Learning Over Time

Your delegate's identity can evolve through conversation. When you give feedback like:

> "That response was too long - keep things shorter."

Your delegate may update its identity to reflect this preference. You can also edit the identity directly to make changes.
