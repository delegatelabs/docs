# Get Started with Delegate

This guide walks you through setting up Delegate and getting your first initiative running.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

Sign up at [app.delegate.ai](https://app.delegate.ai) using your work email. You'll be prompted to create or join an organization.

<Tip>
If your company already uses Delegate, ask a teammate to invite you to your organization.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create Your First Initiative

An initiative is your workspace for a specific project or goal. Click **Create Initiative** and give it a name like "Q1 Planning" or "Customer Onboarding."

Every initiative comes with:
- **Your delegate** - An AI assistant that learns how you work
- **Activity Feed** - Your team workspace for updates, posts, and canvases
- **Delegate Brain** - Configuration for your delegate's behavior, memory, and skills

## Step 3: Start Chatting

The center panel is your Delegate Chat. This is where you talk to your delegate and teach it how you want things done.

Try saying something like:

> "Help me draft an email to the team about our upcoming deadline."

Your delegate will respond and can help with tasks across your connected tools.

## Step 4: Connect Your Integrations

To unlock your delegate's full potential, connect your tools. Click your profile in the sidebar, then **Integrations** to connect:

- **Gmail** - Send and read emails
- **Google Calendar** - Check and manage events
- **Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides** - Access your documents
- **Slack** - Send messages to channels and teammates
- **GitHub** - Manage repositories and issues
- **Notion** - Read and update docs
- **Linear** - Manage issues and projects
- **Figma** - Access design files
- **Zoom** - Manage meetings

<Note>
You control exactly what your delegate can access. Start with read-only access and expand permissions as you get comfortable.
</Note>

## Step 5: Teach Your Delegate

The more you work with your delegate, the better it gets. When you give feedback like:

> "Next time, always include the project deadline in these emails."

Your delegate remembers and applies it going forward.
