# What Can Your Delegate Do?

Your delegate has a wide range of capabilities. Some are built-in, while others depend on which integrations you've connected.

## Built-in Capabilities

These capabilities are always available, no integration required.

### Post to the Activity Feed

Your delegate can share updates with your team by posting messages to the Activity Feed. Posts can include:

- Text updates with markdown formatting
- Canvas attachments with structured layouts
- @mentions to notify specific team members

> **Example:** "Post a weekly summary of completed tasks to the feed."

#### When Your Delegate Posts Automatically

After completing work, your delegate decides whether to post an update to the Activity Feed. It considers:

**Posts automatically when:**
- Work was completed that the team should know about
- Information was gathered that's relevant to share
- An action was taken that affects others

**Stays quiet when:**
- Work is still in progress
- The update would be redundant
- It was a simple informational response in conversation
- Users are in conversation with each other (to avoid interrupting)

You can also explicitly tell your delegate:
> "Post this to the feed" or "Keep this private"

Learn more about how delegates decide when to respond in [Team Collaboration](/activity-feed/collaboration).

### Create and Update Canvases

Canvases are structured documents with grid layouts. Your delegate can create canvases for:

- Project status boards
- Meeting notes with action items
- Comparison tables
- Any structured information

Canvases are versioned, so you can see how they've changed over time.

### Manage Tasks

Your delegate can track work in its brain:

- Create tasks with goals and success criteria
- Mark tasks as complete
- Log progress updates
- Track unfinished business

### Schedule Wakeups

Your delegate can set reminders to wake up and take action:

- **One-time wakeups** - "Remind me to follow up in 3 days"
- **Recurring schedules** - "Every Monday at 9am, review my calendar"

Learn more in [Schedules](/delegate-brain/schedules).

### Look Up Team Members

Your delegate can find and reference people in your organization:

- Search by name or email
- Add members to initiatives
- @mention people in posts

## Integration Capabilities

When you connect integrations, your delegate gains new abilities. Here's what each integration enables:

### Email (Gmail)

- Send emails on your behalf
- Search your inbox
- Read specific emails
- Manage labels

### Calendar (Google Calendar)

- View your schedule
- Create new events
- Check for conflicts
- Find available times

### Documents (Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides)

- Create new documents
- Read existing files
- Update content
- Search for files

### Messaging (Slack)

- Post messages to channels
- Send direct messages
- Browse channels
- Search conversations

### Project Management (Linear, GitHub, Notion)

- Create issues and tasks
- Browse projects and repositories
- Update status
- Search for items

### Design (Figma)

- Browse design files
- Search for components
- View project structures

### Meetings (Zoom)

- Schedule meetings
- Get meeting details
- Manage invites

## How Permissions Work

Your delegate only has access to what you explicitly grant. You control:

- **Which integrations** are connected
- **Read vs. write** access for each
- **Specific resources** (in advanced mode)

For example, you might give your delegate read access to your calendar but not write access, so it can check your schedule but can't create events without asking.

Learn more in [Permissions](/integrations/permissions).

## Requesting New Capabilities

When your delegate needs access to something it doesn't have, it will ask. You'll see an approval request explaining:

- What capability it needs
- Why it needs it
- What it plans to do

You can approve, deny, or ask for more information before deciding.
