# Delegate Ownership & Permissions

Understanding ownership is key to using Delegate effectively, especially in team settings.

## One Delegate Per Person

Every person in an initiative has their own delegate. If you create an initiative, you get a delegate. If you're invited to join an initiative, you get your own delegate there too.

Your delegate is personal to you:
- It learns your preferences, not someone else's
- It acts on your behalf with your permissions
- It remembers your instructions

## Owner vs. Member

In every initiative, there's a distinction between the **owner** and **members**:

### Initiative Owner

The person who created the initiative. The owner can:
- Edit the Delegate Brain configuration
- Set up schedules and automations
- Configure permissions for the delegate
- Invite and remove members

### Initiative Members

People who have been invited to the initiative. Members can:
- Chat with their own delegate
- View the Activity Feed
- Interact with posts and canvases
- Use their connected integrations through their delegate

Members cannot edit the Delegate Brain - only the owner controls that.

## How Permissions Flow

When your delegate takes action, it uses your permissions. This means:

1. **Your integrations** - Your delegate uses the tools you've connected
2. **Your access** - If you can't access something, neither can your delegate
3. **Your approval** - High-stakes actions need your sign-off

### Example

Say you've connected Gmail with read/write access. When you ask your delegate to send an email, it:
1. Uses your Gmail connection
2. Sends from your email address
3. Acts as if you sent it

If a team member triggers an action that affects shared resources, their permissions are used - not yours.

## Triggering Matters

Who triggers the delegate affects which permissions are used:

| Who Triggers | Whose Permissions |
|--------------|-------------------|
| You chat with your delegate | Your permissions |
| Team member comments on your post | Their permissions |
| Scheduled wakeup runs | Schedule creator's permissions |

This is important for team safety. If someone comments on a post and your delegate responds, it uses that person's permissions, not the post author's.

## Controlling Access

You have granular control over what your delegate can do:

### Simple Mode

Toggle integrations on/off:
- ✅ Gmail - Read & Write
- ✅ Calendar - Read only
- ❌ Slack - Not connected

### Advanced Mode

Request specific resources and capabilities:
- Access to specific Google Docs
- Ability to post to specific Slack channels
- Read access to specific Linear projects

Learn more in [Permissions](/integrations/permissions).

## Revoking Access

You can revoke your delegate's access at any time:
- Disconnect an integration entirely
- Remove specific resources
- Downgrade from write to read-only

Changes take effect immediately.
