# Chatting with Your Delegate

The Delegate Chat is your private 1:1 conversation with your delegate. It's where you give instructions, ask questions, and teach your delegate how you want things done.

## Where to Find It

The chat panel is in the center of your screen when you're in an initiative. On the left is the sidebar with your initiatives list, and on the right is the Activity Feed or Delegate Brain.

## Starting a Conversation

Just type a message and press Enter. You can:

- **Ask questions** - "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"
- **Give instructions** - "Draft an email to the team about the deadline"
- **Provide feedback** - "Next time, make the summary shorter"
- **Teach preferences** - "Always include action items at the top"

Your delegate will respond and may take actions on your behalf, like sending an email or posting to the Activity Feed.

## Watching Your Delegate Work

When your delegate takes action, you'll see it happening in real-time:

1. **Tool calls appear** - Shows what action is being taken
2. **Status updates** - Running → Completed
3. **Results shown** - What was accomplished

For example, if you ask your delegate to send an email, you'll see:
- The `send_email` tool being called
- The email details (recipient, subject, body)
- Confirmation that it was sent

## Approvals

Some actions require your approval before they execute. When this happens:

1. Your delegate explains what it wants to do
2. You see an approval request with details
3. You can approve or dismiss

This gives you control over high-stakes actions while letting routine tasks flow automatically.

## Tips for Effective Communication

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Help me with emails"

Try: "Draft a follow-up email to Sarah about the project timeline we discussed yesterday"

### Give Context

Your delegate remembers your conversations, but giving context helps it understand your intent:

> "The client from the call this morning asked about pricing - can you find the pricing doc and summarize the enterprise tier?"

### Correct and Teach

When your delegate does something you don't like, tell it:

> "That summary was too long. Keep summaries under 3 bullet points."

Your delegate learns from this feedback and applies it going forward.

### Use Examples

Show your delegate what good looks like:

> "Here's how I want status updates formatted:
> - Project name in bold
> - 3 key accomplishments
> - Next steps as action items"

## Private vs. Public

Your chat with your delegate is private - only you can see it. When your delegate posts to the Activity Feed, that's public to everyone in the initiative.

You can instruct your delegate on what to keep private vs. what to share:

> "Summarize this for me privately, then post a shorter version to the feed."
