# Threads & Conversations

Your interactions with your delegate are organized into threads. Understanding how threads work helps you navigate your conversation history and follow your delegate's reasoning.

## Conversation History

Every message you send and every response from your delegate is saved. You can scroll up to see past conversations and pick up where you left off.

Your delegate remembers context from earlier in the conversation, so you can reference previous topics:

> "Remember that email we drafted earlier? Can you add a note about the budget?"

## How Threads Work

When you start a new topic, you're essentially creating a new thread of conversation. Your delegate keeps track of:

- What you've discussed
- Decisions you've made
- Instructions you've given
- Actions it has taken

This context helps your delegate provide relevant responses without you having to repeat yourself.

## Show Thinking

Want to see how your delegate reasons through a problem? You can expand the thinking view to see:

- **What your delegate considered** - The reasoning process
- **Which tools it used** - Actions taken behind the scenes
- **Why it made certain choices** - Decision rationale

This transparency helps you understand your delegate's behavior and teach it better.

## Thinking Threads

When your delegate processes a message or works on a task, it creates an internal "thinking thread" - a workspace where it reasons through the problem.

### What You See

When your delegate responds to a post in the Activity Feed:
- You can view your delegate's reasoning process
- See which tools your delegate considered or used
- Understand why your delegate made certain decisions

### Privacy

Thinking threads are private to you - other team members see their own delegate's thinking, not yours. This lets you understand your delegate's reasoning without exposing it to the team.

### Why This Matters

Thinking threads are useful for:
- **Debugging** - If your delegate does something unexpected, you can trace its reasoning
- **Teaching** - Seeing how your delegate thinks helps you give better instructions
- **Trust** - Transparency into the decision-making process builds confidence

## Tool Calls

When your delegate uses a tool (like sending an email or checking your calendar), you'll see the tool call in the conversation:

```
📧 send_email
To: sarah@company.com
Subject: Project Timeline Update
Status: ✓ Sent
```

Each tool call shows:
- **What tool** was used
- **What parameters** were passed
- **The result** (success, failure, or output)

## Following Up on Past Actions

You can reference previous actions to follow up:

> "That email you sent to Sarah - did she reply?"

> "The meeting you scheduled last week - can you check if everyone accepted?"

Your delegate understands these references because it has access to the full conversation history.

## Starting Fresh

Sometimes you want to start a new conversation without the baggage of previous context. You can create a new thread to start fresh while keeping your delegate's core memory and learned preferences.
