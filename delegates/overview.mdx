# What is a Delegate?

A delegate is your personal AI teammate within an initiative. It's not a chatbot that forgets everything after each conversation, and it's not a rigid automation that breaks when things change. It's an AI assistant that learns how you work and handles coordination on your behalf.

## One Delegate Per Person

Each person in an initiative has their own delegate. Your delegate is yours alone - it learns your preferences, remembers your instructions, and acts according to how you've taught it.

When you create an initiative, you automatically get a delegate. When you're invited to join someone else's initiative, you get your own delegate there too.

## How Delegates Learn

Every conversation with your delegate is an opportunity to teach it. When you say things like:

> "Always CC my manager on client emails."

> "When summarizing meetings, focus on action items first."

> "If someone asks about pricing, check the pricing doc before responding."

Your delegate remembers these instructions and applies them going forward. This learning happens through:

- **Direct instructions** - Tell your delegate explicitly how to handle things
- **Feedback** - Correct your delegate when it does something wrong
- **Examples** - Show your delegate what good looks like

## What Delegates Can Do

Your delegate has a wide range of capabilities:

## The Delegate Brain

Every delegate has a "brain" - a configuration space where you control how it behaves. The brain includes:

- **Identity** - Personality, tone, and communication style
- **Tasks** - What your delegate is working on
- **Memory** - What your delegate remembers about you and your work
- **Skills** - Specialized procedures your delegate knows
- **Schedules** - Recurring check-ins and automations
- **Permissions** - What tools and resources your delegate can access

## Delegates vs. Chatbots

| Chatbots | Delegates |
|----------|-----------|
| Forget everything between sessions | Remember your preferences and instructions |
| Can only respond to your messages | Can act proactively on schedules |
| Limited to conversation | Can use your tools (email, calendar, Slack) |
| Generic responses | Personalized to how you work |
| One-size-fits-all | Learns and adapts over time |
