# Meet Delegate

Delegate is an AI teammate that learns how you work and handles coordination on your behalf. It's not a chatbot that forgets everything after each conversation. It's not a rigid workflow that breaks when things change. It's a teammate you teach once, and it takes it from there.

## What Makes Delegate Different

**It learns from you.** Every conversation teaches your delegate how you want things done. Say "always CC my manager on these emails" or "prioritize urgent requests from the sales team" and it remembers.

**It works across your tools.** Delegate connects to Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, Notion, Linear, GitHub, and more. It reads, writes, and coordinates across all of them on your behalf.

**It stays in sync with your team.** The Activity Feed shows everyone what's happening. Your delegate can post updates, respond to comments, and keep the team informed without you lifting a finger.

**It runs on your schedule.** Set up scheduled check-ins like "every Monday at 9am, review my calendar and flag conflicts" and your delegate handles it automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Create an initiative** - Your workspace for a project or goal
2. **Chat with your delegate** - Teach it how you want things handled
3. **Connect your tools** - Give it access to Gmail, Slack, Calendar, etc.
4. **Let it work** - Your delegate handles coordination while you focus on what matters
