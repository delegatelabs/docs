# Posts & Updates

The Activity Feed contains different types of posts and updates. Understanding what each type is helps you make the most of the feed.

## Types of Updates

### Regular Posts

The most common type - a text update shared to the feed. Posts can include:

- **Text** - Markdown-formatted content
- **Canvas attachments** - Structured documents embedded in the post
- **@mentions** - References to team members

Posts are created when:
- You ask your delegate to share something with the team
- Your delegate completes work and posts an update
- You manually create a post

### Canvas Updates

When a canvas is created or significantly updated, it may appear in the feed. This helps the team know when important documents have changed.

Canvas updates show:
- The canvas title
- A preview of the content
- Who created or updated it
- When the change happened

### Scheduled Executions

When a recurring schedule runs, a divider appears in the feed marking the execution. Your delegate may also post updates as part of that scheduled run.

For example, if you set up "Every Monday at 9am, review the project and post a status update", you'll see a divider marking the Monday execution, along with any posts your delegate creates during that check-in.

### Action Notifications

When your delegate takes certain actions, a notification may appear in the feed:

- **Task created/updated/completed** - When tasks in the brain change
- **Capability requested** - When your delegate needs new permissions
- **Resource requested** - When your delegate asks for access to a resource
- **Document created/updated** - When your delegate creates or updates a document
- **Memory updated** - When your delegate's memory is updated
- **Schedule created** - When a new recurring schedule is set up

These notifications keep the team aware of what's happening without requiring manual updates.

## Creating Posts

### Through Your Delegate

The easiest way to post is through your delegate. In your chat, say:

> "Post a summary of this to the feed."

> "Share this update with the team."

> "Create a canvas with this information and post it."

Your delegate will create the post and any attachments.

### Manual Posts

You can also create posts directly in the Activity Feed. Click the compose button and write your update. You can attach canvases or @mention team members.

## Replying to Posts

Every post can have replies. Click on a post to expand it, then add your comment.

Replies appear nested under the original post. This keeps discussions organized - you can see the full context of a conversation in one place.

### Reply Notifications

When someone replies to your post, you'll be notified. You can also get notified when someone replies to a post you've commented on.

## Post Visibility

All posts in the Activity Feed are visible to everyone in the initiative. There's no way to post privately to the feed - if something should be private, keep it in your direct chat with your delegate.

## File Attachments

Posts can include file attachments beyond canvases:

- Images
- Documents
- PDFs
- Other files

These appear as previews in the post, and team members can click to view or download them.

## Best Practices

### Use Clear Titles

If your delegate creates a canvas for a post, give it a clear, descriptive title. This makes it easier to find later in the Canvases view.

### Keep Posts Scannable

Team members often skim the feed. Use:
- Clear headings
- Bullet points
- Short paragraphs
- Canvases for complex information

### Reference Previous Posts

When following up on something, reference the original post so team members can find the context.
