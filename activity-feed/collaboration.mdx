# Team Collaboration

The Activity Feed is where team collaboration happens. Everyone sees the same updates, can join discussions, and stays informed about what's happening.

## How Collaboration Works

### Commenting on Posts

When someone posts to the feed, anyone in the initiative can reply. Click on a post to expand it and add your comment.

Comments are threaded under the original post, keeping discussions organized and in context.

### @Mentions

You can @mention team members in posts and comments. When you mention someone:

- They get notified
- Their name appears as a clickable link
- They can easily find the post that mentions them

> **Example:** "@Sarah can you review this before the meeting?"

### Delegate Responses

When someone comments on a post, delegates may respond if it's relevant. For example:

- If someone asks a question a delegate can answer
- If a comment requests follow-up action
- If clarification is needed on something a delegate posted

This creates a natural flow where the AI can participate in team discussions.

## How Delegates Decide to Respond

When a message appears in the Activity Feed, delegates don't automatically respond to everything. Each delegate evaluates whether to engage:

**Always responds when:**
- You're chatting directly with your delegate (private conversation)
- A scheduled wakeup triggers
- The Delegate Brain was just updated

**Evaluates whether to respond when:**
- Someone posts or comments in the Activity Feed
- The delegate considers: Is this relevant to my role? Does it mention me? Does it need action?

If a delegate decides not to engage, it silently skips responding. This prevents delegates from over-participating in conversations where they're not needed.

**Note:** If someone @mentions your delegate directly, it will always respond regardless of other factors.

## Multiple Delegates in an Initiative

When you post to the Activity Feed, every delegate in the initiative sees the message. Each delegate independently decides whether to respond based on:

- Their configured role and identity
- Whether the message is relevant to them
- Whether they can add value

This means different team members' delegates might respond to different messages based on their areas of focus.

## Who Triggers What

An important concept: **who triggers the delegate affects whose permissions are used**.

| Scenario | Whose Permissions |
|----------|-------------------|
| You post to the feed | Your permissions |
| Team member comments on your post | Their permissions |
| Delegate responds to a comment | Commenter's permissions |

This means if a team member asks your delegate to do something via a comment, the delegate uses that team member's permissions - not yours.

## Visibility

Everything in the Activity Feed is visible to everyone in the initiative:

- All posts are public to the team
- All comments are public to the team
- Canvas attachments are visible to everyone
- Delegate responses are visible to everyone

If you need to communicate something privately, use your direct chat with your delegate instead of the feed.

## Notifications

When you're @mentioned in a post or comment, you automatically receive a notification. This ensures you never miss when someone needs your attention.

### Smart Notifications

Delegate uses intelligent notifications - not every action creates a notification. Instead, your delegate evaluates each event to determine:

**Who should be notified:**
- Each stakeholder is evaluated individually
- Notification rules in the Delegate Brain guide these decisions
- You won't get notified about your own actions (unless something went wrong)

**Whether notification is needed:**
- Distinguishes between informational updates vs. action required
- Avoids duplicate notifications
- Respects notification preferences

### Configuring Notifications

The initiative owner can configure notification rules in the Delegate Brain under the Notifications section. This lets you specify:
- Which stakeholders should be notified about what
- What types of events warrant notifications
- Priority levels for different scenarios

## Best Practices

### Keep Posts Focused

Each post should cover one topic. If you have multiple updates, create separate posts so discussions stay organized.

### Use Canvases for Structure

When sharing complex information, attach a canvas instead of writing a long text post. Canvases are easier to read and can be referenced later.

### Let the Delegate Post Updates

Instead of manually posting status updates, teach your delegate to post them for you:

> "Every Friday, post a summary of completed tasks to the feed."

This automates routine communication while keeping the team informed.
