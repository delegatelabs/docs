# Activity Feed Overview

The Activity Feed is like an event log for your initiative. Everything that happens - posts, canvas updates, scheduled messages, and delegate actions - shows up here for everyone to see.

## What the Feed Shows

The Activity Feed captures all activity in your initiative:

- **Posts** - Updates shared by you or your delegate
- **Canvas updates** - When canvases are created or modified
- **Scheduled messages** - Updates from recurring check-ins
- **Follow-ups** - Responses and continuations of previous work
- **Action notifications** - When your delegate completes tasks

Think of it as a timeline of your initiative's progress.

## How It Works

### Posts Flow Down

New posts appear at the top of the feed. As more activity happens, older posts move down. This keeps the most recent updates front and center.

### Threaded Replies

Each post can have replies. When someone comments on a post, the replies appear nested under it. This keeps discussions organized and connected to their original context.

### Canvas Attachments

Posts can include canvas attachments - structured documents with grid layouts. These appear embedded in the post, making it easy to share formatted information like status boards, meeting notes, or comparison tables.

## Team Visibility

Everyone in the initiative sees the same Activity Feed. This creates shared awareness:

- Team members know what's happening without asking
- Your delegate's work is visible to everyone
- Discussions happen in context, not scattered across channels

## Your Delegate and the Feed

Your delegate can post to the Activity Feed on your behalf. Common scenarios:

- **Status updates** - "Here's a summary of what I completed this week"
- **Sharing work** - "I created a canvas with the comparison you asked for"
- **Scheduled check-ins** - Automatic posts from recurring schedules
- **Responding to comments** - When someone comments, your delegate may reply

You control when your delegate posts. In your chat, you can say:

> "Post this to the feed for the team."

> "Keep this private, don't share it."

## Feed vs. Canvases View

The right panel has two views you can toggle between:

| Feed View | Canvases View |
|-----------|---------------|
| Chronological stream of posts | Grid of all canvases |
| See what's new | Find specific documents |
| Follow discussions | Browse reference materials |
| Catch up on activity | Access structured content |

Use Feed View for staying current. Use Canvases View when you need to find a specific document.
