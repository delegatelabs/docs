# The Activity Feed

The Activity Feed is your team's shared workspace within an initiative. It's where updates appear, discussions happen, and work becomes visible to everyone.

## What Shows Up in the Feed

The Activity Feed displays:

- **Posts** - Updates from you or your delegate
- **Canvas attachments** - Structured documents embedded in posts
- **Comments and replies** - Team discussions on posts
- **Scheduled messages** - Updates from recurring check-ins
- **Action notifications** - When your delegate completes tasks

Think of it like a shared timeline of everything happening in your initiative.

## Feed vs. Canvases View

The Activity Feed has two views you can toggle between:

### Feed View

A chronological stream of posts and updates. Best for:
- Seeing what's new
- Following discussions
- Catching up on activity

### Canvases View

A grid of all canvases created in the initiative. Best for:
- Finding specific documents
- Browsing structured content
- Accessing reference materials

## Your Delegate and the Feed

Your delegate can post to the Activity Feed on your behalf. This is useful for:

- Sharing status updates with the team
- Publishing completed work
- Announcing schedule reminders
- Summarizing information for everyone

When you chat with your delegate, you can tell it:

> "Post a summary of this to the feed."

> "Share this update with the team."

Your delegate will create a post that everyone in the initiative can see.

## Team Collaboration

Everyone in the initiative can:
- View all posts in the feed
- Reply to posts with comments
- React to updates
- See canvas attachments

When someone comments on a post, the delegate may respond if relevant. This creates a natural flow of collaboration where the AI can participate in team discussions.
