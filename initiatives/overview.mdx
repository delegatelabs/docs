# What is an Initiative?

An initiative is your workspace in Delegate. It's where you, your delegate, and your team come together to work on a project or goal.

## Creating an Initiative

When you create an initiative, you get:

- **Your delegate** - An AI assistant that learns how you work
- **Activity Feed** - A shared space for updates and collaboration
- **Delegate Brain** - Configuration for how your delegate behaves
- **Canvases** - Structured documents you and your delegate create

Give your initiative a name that reflects its purpose, like "Q1 Planning", "Customer Onboarding", or "Product Launch".

## The Three-Panel Layout

When you open an initiative, you'll see three main areas:

### Left: Sidebar

The sidebar shows:
- Your list of initiatives
- Quick access to archived initiatives
- Your profile and settings

### Center: Delegate Chat

The center panel is your private conversation with your delegate. This is where you:
- Give instructions
- Ask questions
- Get help with tasks
- Teach your delegate how you work

### Right: Activity Feed or Delegate Brain

The right panel toggles between two views:

**Activity Feed** - Your team workspace where:
- Your delegate posts updates
- Team members comment and collaborate
- Canvases are displayed

**Delegate Brain** - Your delegate's configuration where you set up:
- Identity and personality
- Tasks and goals
- Memory and skills
- Schedules and automations

## Inviting Team Members

You can invite others to your initiative. When they join, they get their own delegate in that initiative. Everyone sees the shared Activity Feed, but each person's chat with their delegate is private.

To invite someone:
1. Open the initiative
2. Go to settings
3. Add members by email

## Archiving Initiatives

When a project is done or paused, you can archive the initiative. Archived initiatives:
- Disappear from your main list
- Can be accessed from the archive
- Keep all their history and data
- Can be unarchived anytime
