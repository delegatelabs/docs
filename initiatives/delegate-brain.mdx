# The Delegate Brain

The Delegate Brain is where you configure your delegate's behavior. It's the control center for how your delegate thinks, communicates, and takes action.

## Accessing the Brain

Click the "Brain" tab in the right panel of your initiative to open the Delegate Brain. Here you'll find all the configuration options for your delegate.

## What's in the Brain

The Delegate Brain has several sections:

### Identity

Control how your delegate communicates:
- Personality and tone
- Communication style
- Role and responsibilities

### Tasks

What your delegate is working on:
- Active tasks with goals
- Success criteria
- Progress tracking

### Memory

What your delegate remembers:
- Important context about you
- Key information about projects
- Learned preferences

### Skills

Specialized procedures your delegate knows:
- Step-by-step workflows
- Best practices for specific tasks
- Custom instructions for recurring work

### Schedules

Automated check-ins and reminders:
- Recurring schedules (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Specific times and intervals
- What to check on each run

### Permissions

What your delegate can access:
- Connected integrations
- Read vs. write permissions
- Specific resources (in advanced mode)

### Progress Log

A running log of your delegate's actions:
- What tasks have been completed
- Updates and milestones
- History of delegate activity

### Unfinished Business

What your delegate still needs to do:
- Pending items from previous conversations
- Tasks waiting on external input
- Follow-ups to complete

### Initiative Context

Shared context for the entire initiative:
- Background information about the project
- Key goals and objectives
- Important context all team members should know

## Who Can Edit the Brain

Only the **initiative owner** can edit the Delegate Brain. If you're a member (not the owner), you can view the brain configuration but not change it.

This ensures one person has control over how the initiative's delegate behaves, preventing conflicting configurations.

## How the Brain Affects Behavior

Everything in the Delegate Brain influences how your delegate acts:

- **Identity** shapes communication style
- **Tasks** guide what your delegate prioritizes
- **Memory** provides context for decisions
- **Skills** determine how specific tasks are handled
- **Schedules** trigger automatic check-ins
- **Permissions** control what actions are possible
- **Progress Log** tracks what's been done
- **Unfinished Business** ensures nothing falls through the cracks
- **Initiative Context** provides shared background for all decisions

When you chat with your delegate, it draws on all of this to provide relevant, personalized help.
