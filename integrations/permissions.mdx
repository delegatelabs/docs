# Integration Permissions

Permissions control what your delegate can do with each connected integration. You decide the level of access, and you can change it at any time.

## Permission Modes

Delegate offers two permission modes:

### Simple Mode

A straightforward toggle for each integration:

- **Read** - Your delegate can view information
- **Write** - Your delegate can also create and modify content
- **Off** - No access to this integration

Simple mode offers easy on/off control without complexity.

### Advanced Mode (Default)

Fine-grained control over specific resources and capabilities:

- **Request specific resources** - Access to particular documents, channels, or repositories
- **Capability-level permissions** - Control individual actions like "send email" vs. "search inbox"
- **Granular scopes** - Different access levels for different resources

Advanced mode gives you precise control when you need it.

## Switching Modes

You can switch between Simple and Advanced mode in your integration settings:

1. Go to **Profile → Integrations**
2. Click on any integration
3. Toggle between **Simple** and **Advanced** mode

Switching to Advanced mode preserves your existing permissions as a starting point.

## How Permissions Work

### Read vs. Write

| Read Access | Write Access |
|-------------|--------------|
| View emails | Send emails |
| See calendar events | Create events |
| Read documents | Edit documents |
| Browse Slack channels | Post messages |
| View issues | Create/update issues |

Write access always includes read access.

### Resource-Level Permissions (Advanced Mode)

In Advanced mode, you can grant access to specific resources:

- **Specific Google Docs** - Not all docs, just certain ones
- **Specific Slack channels** - Post to #general but not #private
- **Specific repositories** - Access repo A but not repo B

Your delegate will request access to new resources as needed. You approve or deny each request.

### Capability-Level Permissions (Advanced Mode)

Control specific actions independently:

**Gmail example:**
- ✅ Search inbox
- ✅ Read emails
- ❌ Send emails
- ❌ Manage labels

**Calendar example:**
- ✅ View events
- ❌ Create events
- ❌ Delete events

## Approval Workflow

In Advanced mode, your delegate may need to request new permissions:

1. **Delegate encounters need** - Trying to do something it doesn't have access to
2. **Request sent** - You see an approval request explaining what's needed
3. **You decide** - Approve, deny, or ask for more information
4. **Access granted/denied** - Your decision takes effect immediately

This keeps you informed and in control as your delegate's needs evolve.

## Revoking Access

You can revoke access at any level:

### Remove a Resource
In Advanced mode, remove access to a specific document, channel, or repository.

### Downgrade Permissions
Change from write to read-only for an integration.

### Disconnect Entirely
Remove all access to an integration.

Changes take effect immediately.

## Best Practices

### Start Conservative

Begin with read-only access and expand as needed. It's easier to grant more access than to undo actions.

### Use Advanced Mode for Sensitive Tools

For tools with sensitive data (email, financial systems), consider Advanced mode for fine-grained control.

### Review Periodically

Check your integration permissions occasionally to ensure they still match your needs.

### Trust But Verify

Your delegate will explain what it's trying to do. Review its actions in the Activity Feed to build confidence.
