# Owner vs. Member Permissions

When multiple people collaborate in an initiative, understanding whose permissions apply becomes important. This page explains how permissions flow based on who triggers the delegate.

## The Core Principle

> **Whoever triggers the delegate uses their own permissions.**

This means:
- When you chat with your delegate, it uses your permissions
- When a team member comments in the feed, their delegate uses their permissions
- When a schedule runs, it uses the owner's permissions

## Why This Matters

Consider this scenario:

1. **You** have Gmail connected with write access
2. **Alex** (team member) has Gmail with read-only access
3. Alex comments: "Send an email to the client about this"

What happens? Alex's delegate attempts to send the email using **Alex's permissions** - which are read-only. The email won't send.

This prevents team members from accidentally (or intentionally) using your permissions for actions they shouldn't take.

## Permission Scenarios

| Who Triggers | Whose Permissions | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| You chat with delegate | Your permissions | "Send an email to Sarah" |
| Team member comments | Their permissions | Member asks to post to Slack |
| Scheduled wakeup runs | Schedule creator's permissions | Weekly status report |
| You comment on member's post | Your permissions | You reply to a team update |

## Owner Permissions

As the initiative owner, your permissions are used for:

- **Your direct conversations** - Everything you ask your delegate to do
- **Your comments in the feed** - When you respond to posts
- **Schedules you create** - Automations you set up run with your permissions

### Example: Scheduled Reports

You set up a schedule: "Every Monday, email the team a status report."

Since you created the schedule, your Gmail connection is used to send the email. Schedules always run with the permissions of whoever created them.

## Member Permissions

As an initiative member, your permissions are used for:

- **Your comments in the feed** - Actions triggered by your comments
- **Your direct conversations** - Chatting with your own delegate
- **Your responses to posts** - When you engage with feed content

### Example: Commenting on Posts

You (a member) comment on a post: "Can you summarize this in Slack?"

Your delegate will try to post to Slack using **your** Slack connection. If you haven't connected Slack or don't have write access, it won't work.

## Protecting the Team

This model exists to protect everyone:

### You're Protected From

- Team members using your write access without your knowledge
- Accidental actions triggered by others' requests
- Unintended scope creep of your permissions

### Team Members Are Protected From

- Actions taken with permissions they didn't grant
- Being held responsible for actions using your access
- Confusion about whose account was used

## Shared Resources

Some resources can be explicitly shared with the team:

### Owner-Only Resources

When you share a resource with "owner" scope, only your permissions can use it. Team member requests won't have access.

### Team-Wide Resources

When you share a resource with "all" scope, any team member's delegate can use it (with their own OAuth permissions as a baseline).

## Best Practices

### For Owners

- **Set up schedules thoughtfully** - They use your permissions
- **Be clear about shared resources** - Know what's owner-only vs. team-wide
- **Review scheduled actions** - They run as you, not as team members

### For Members

- **Connect your own integrations** - You can't rely on the owner's
- **Understand your access** - Your comments trigger your permissions
- **Ask before expecting access** - You may need resources shared with you

## Troubleshooting

### "Why didn't my request work?"

Check if:
1. You have the integration connected
2. You have the right permission level (read vs. write)
3. For specific resources, they're shared with you (in Advanced mode)

### "The schedule sent from the wrong account"

Schedules use the permissions of whoever created them. Check who created the schedule - that person's integrations will be used.
