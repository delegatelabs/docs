# Integrations Overview

Integrations connect your delegate to external tools like Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, and more. Once connected, your delegate can read from and write to these tools on your behalf.

## Connecting Integrations

To connect an integration:

1. Click your profile in the sidebar
2. Select **Integrations**
3. Click **Connect** next to the integration you want
4. Authorize access through the OAuth flow
5. Configure permissions (what your delegate can do)

Once connected, your delegate can use the integration immediately.

## What Integrations Enable

With integrations connected, your delegate can:

- **Send emails** on your behalf
- **Schedule meetings** and check calendar conflicts
- **Create documents** and update existing ones
- **Post to Slack** channels or send direct messages
- **Create issues** in Linear or GitHub
- **Search across** your connected tools

## The Expectation of Control Model

Delegate follows an "expectation of control" model for permissions:

> **Your delegate only has access to what you explicitly grant.**

This means:
- Your delegate can't access tools you haven't connected
- You control read vs. write permissions for each tool
- You can revoke access at any time
- Your OAuth permissions still apply - your delegate piggybacks on your access

This model ensures you stay in control of what your delegate can do.

## Permission Levels

When connecting an integration, you choose the permission level:

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Read** | View information but can't make changes |
| **Write** | Can create and modify content |
| **Read + Write** | Full access to view and modify |

Start with read-only access and expand as you get comfortable.

## Managing Integrations

### Viewing Connected Integrations

Go to **Profile → Integrations** to see all your connected integrations and their permission levels.

### Changing Permissions

You can adjust permissions at any time:
- Upgrade from read to write
- Downgrade from write to read-only
- Enable or disable specific capabilities

### Disconnecting

To disconnect an integration:
1. Go to **Profile → Integrations**
2. Find the integration
3. Click **Disconnect**

Your delegate immediately loses access to that tool.
