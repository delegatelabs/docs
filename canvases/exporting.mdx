# Exporting Canvases

You can export canvases as PDFs to share outside of Delegate or keep for your records.

## How to Export

Exporting a canvas is a two-step process:

### Step 1: Export to HTML

1. Open the canvas you want to export
2. Click the **Export** button
3. A clean HTML version opens in a new browser tab

### Step 2: Save as PDF

From the HTML page that opened:

**On Mac:**
1. Press **Cmd + P** to open the print dialog
2. Click **Save as PDF** in the destination dropdown
3. Choose where to save the file
4. Click **Save**

**On Windows:**
1. Press **Ctrl + P** to open the print dialog
2. Select **Microsoft Print to PDF** as the printer
3. Click **Print**
4. Choose where to save the file

## Tips for Clean Exports

### Use Print Preview

Before saving, check the print preview to make sure:
- All cards are visible
- The layout looks correct
- No content is cut off

### Adjust Page Settings

In the print dialog, you can adjust:
- **Orientation** - Landscape often works better for wide canvases
- **Scale** - Shrink to fit if content is cut off
- **Margins** - Reduce margins for more content space

### Remove Browser Elements

Most browsers have options to hide headers/footers that add URLs and dates to printed pages. Look for "Headers and footers" option in print settings.

## Sharing Exports

Once you have a PDF, you can:

- **Email** - Attach to emails for stakeholders
- **Cloud storage** - Upload to Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
- **Print** - Create physical copies
- **Archive** - Keep for records

## Alternative: Screenshots

For quick sharing, you can also take screenshots:

### On Mac
- **Cmd + Shift + 4** - Select area to capture
- **Cmd + Shift + 5** - More screenshot options

### On Windows
- **Win + Shift + S** - Snipping tool
- **Print Screen** - Capture entire screen

Screenshots work well for sharing in Slack, email, or presentations where you don't need a formal PDF.

## Best Practices

### Export Key Versions

When a canvas reaches an important milestone (end of project, major decision, etc.), export a PDF to preserve that snapshot.

### Name Files Clearly

Use descriptive names like:
- `Q2-Project-Status-2024-03-15.pdf`
- `Vendor-Comparison-Final.pdf`
- `Sprint-Retrospective-Week-12.pdf`

### Keep an Archive

Consider maintaining a folder of exported canvases for:
- Project retrospectives
- Stakeholder reports
- Compliance or audit trails
