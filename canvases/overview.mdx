# Canvases Overview

Canvases are structured documents that organize information into a grid of cards. They're perfect for status boards, comparison tables, meeting notes, and any content that benefits from visual organization.

## What is a Canvas?

A canvas is a document made up of "cards" arranged in a grid. Each card contains markdown content and can span multiple columns. The result is a visually organized document that's easier to scan than plain text.

Think of it like a flexible whiteboard where information is organized into sections.

## When to Use Canvases

Canvases work well for:

- **Status boards** - Project progress with sections for each workstream
- **Comparison tables** - Side-by-side comparisons of options
- **Meeting notes** - Structured notes with attendees, decisions, action items
- **Dashboards** - Key metrics and highlights organized visually
- **Planning documents** - Goals, milestones, and timelines

## Creating Canvases

### Through Your Delegate

Ask your delegate to create a canvas:

> "Create a canvas comparing the three vendor options we discussed."

> "Make a project status board with sections for design, engineering, and marketing."

> "Turn these meeting notes into a structured canvas."

Your delegate will create the canvas and can attach it to a post in the Activity Feed.

### Specifying Layout

You can guide the layout:

> "Make it a 2-column layout."

> "Create a 3x2 grid with cards for each team."

> "Put the summary at the top spanning the full width."

## The 12-Column Grid

Canvases use a 12-column grid system. Each card can span 1-12 columns:

| Columns | Layout |
|---------|--------|
| 12 | Full width (single card per row) |
| 6 | Two cards side by side |
| 4 | Three cards per row |
| 3 | Four cards per row |

Your delegate handles the grid math - just describe the layout you want in plain language.

## Canvas Versions

Every change to a canvas creates a new version. This means:

- **History preserved** - See how a canvas evolved over time
- **Change tracking** - Know what changed and when
- **Restore previous versions** - Go back if needed

When a canvas is updated, a new version is created with a summary of what changed.

### Browsing Versions

Use the version dropdown on any canvas to:

- View any previous version
- See what the canvas looked like at different points in time
- Compare how content has evolved

The "latest" badge indicates you're viewing the current version.

## Viewing Canvases

Canvases appear in two places:

### In the Activity Feed

When a canvas is attached to a post, it appears embedded in the feed. Click to expand and view the full canvas.

### In the Canvases Tab

In the right panel, switch from the **Feed** tab to the **Canvases** tab to see all canvases in the initiative as a grid. This makes it easy to find and browse your canvas library.

## Updating Canvases

### Through Your Delegate

Your delegate can update existing canvases:

> "Update the project status canvas with this week's progress."

> "Add a new section to the comparison canvas for pricing."

### Editing Directly

You can also edit canvases yourself:

1. Open the canvas
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Click on any card to edit its content (supports markdown)
4. Click **Done** or click outside to save

Both methods create a new version, so you always have the history.

## Canvas Cards

Each card in a canvas supports:

- **Markdown formatting** - Headers, lists, bold, italics
- **Tables** - Structured data within a card
- **Code blocks** - Syntax-highlighted code
- **Links** - References to other resources

Cards are meant to be focused - one topic or section per card.
